bio: I have over 15+ years of experience into designing and developing large
  scale enterprise level applications. The phrase Jack of All trades would suit
  me well, though I have over 10 years of experience building Python
  applications. My primary programming language up until recently was Python,
  but I am increasingly falling in love with Go :) . Come say a Hi on my Linked
  in page.
